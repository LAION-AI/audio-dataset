## Preprocessing Principles
You may refer to [preprocess_UrbanSound8K.py](https://github.com/LAION-AI/audio-dataset/blob/main/data_preprocess/preprocess_UrbanSound8K.py) for all the details. Here we just offer a concise summary:
### Overview
Some audio-json pairs selected from the processed dataset:

### I. Json file generation principles 
 
 Information about  `file_name`, `freesound_id`, `start`, `end`, `salience_id`, `fold` and `class_id` are offered within the two `.csv` metadata files: `UrbanSound8K.csv` and `freesoundsource.csv`.  
-  **` text  entry`**  There are not any human-written captions available, hence we have to make up caption by this template: 
    > "The sound of " + class_label (retrieved according to `class_id`) + "."    
- **`tag  entry`** In UrbanSound8K, each audio has just a unique class label, we put it here.
- **`original_data  entry`** All above information in the two `.csv` files mentioned above are stored here
### II. Audio filtering principles
Discard all audios failed to be read by `soundfile.read()` method or denied by FFmpeg while processing.
### III. Audio format specifications
After the preprocessing work, all audio files should be in FLAC format with sampling rate of 48KHZ. (Processed by ffmpeg).
