| [Audiostock Website](https://audiostock.net/se)  |1.Scrape sound effects audio files URLs and the title of effects from Audiostock website. 2. Create meta.csv - file with audio file URLs and titles. 3. Download mp3 audio file for each row in meta.csv and create audio-json pairs for each <br>
## Preprocessing Principles

You may refer to [preprocess_audiostock.py](/data_preprocess/preprocess_audiostock.py) for all the details. Here is a concise summary:

We retrieve information
from the meta data (meta.csv) and form a 3-field `.json` file for each audio. Here are some audio-json pairs selected from the processed dataset:

### I. Json file generation principles 
-  **` text  entry`** We take title of the sound effect and put it into test attribute.
-  **` tag  entry`** We use tags from Audiostock website.
-  **` original data`** We save URL, scene, purpose and impression (all those attributes are present on Audiostock website) for every audio as well as audio duration, the dataset name and dataset description.

### II. Audio filtering principles
1. Keep audios with sampling rate higher than **16KHZ** and discard the rest.
2. Discard all audios failed to be read by `soundfile.read()` method or denied by FFmpeg while processing.
3. Split evry audio in segements with one sentence in each.
### III. Audio format specifications
After the preprocessing work, all audio files should be in FLAC format with sampling rate of 48KHZ. (Processed by ffmpeg).
