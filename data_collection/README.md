# Dataset collection (Dataset List)
This dataset list includes all the [raw datasets](../data_preprocess/README.md) we have found up to now. You may also find their Data Type* as well as their status*.

 Most datasets are made public, hence downloadable through the URL in the list. You may find download scripts for some of them in `audio-dataset/utils/`. For those datasets who do not have any link in the list, they are purchased by LAION hence we can not make it public due to license issue. Do please contact us if you want to process them.

For using the excat processed dataset for training your models, please contact LAION.

## *Data Type Terminology Explanation
- **Caption**: A natural language sentence describing the content of the audio
    > Example: A wooden door creaks open and closed multiple times
    
- **Class label**: Labels that are often manually annotated for classification in curated datasets. Each audio clip can be assigned with one or several class label. 

    > Example: Cat, Dog, Water

- **Tag**: Tags of the audio that are commenly associated with data in website. A audio clip may be associated to several tags

    > Example: phone recording, city, sound effect

- **Relative text**: Any text about the audio. May be comments on the audio, or other metadata. Can be very long.
    > Exmaple: An impact sound that I would hear over an action scene, with some cinematic drums for more tension and a high pitched preexplosion sound followed by the impact of the explosion. Please rate only if you like it, haha. Thanks!

- **Transcription**: Transcription of human speech. Only used for Speech Datasets. 
- **Translation**: Transcription in an other language of what the speaker uses. 

## *Status Terminology Explanation
- **processed**: Dataset already converted to webdataset format.
- **processing**: Dataset already downloaded and the processing going on.
- **meatadata downloaded**: We already know how to scrape the dataset website, wheras dataset is not yet downloaded. 
- **assigned**: Someone have begun the work on the dataset.

| AudioSet                                         |The AudioSet dataset is a large-scale collection of human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. To collect all our data we worked with human annotators who verified the presence of sounds they heard within YouTube segments. To nominate segments for annotation, we relied on YouTube metadata and content-based search. The sound events in the dataset consist of a subset of the AudioSet ontology. You can learn more about the dataset construction in our ICASSP 2017 paper. Explore the dataset annotations by sound class below. There are 2,084,320 YouTube videos containing 527 labels   | [Click here](https://research.google.com/audioset/)                                    | class labels, video, audio                           |processed                 |

|        Free Music Archive       | We introduce the Free Music Archive (FMA), an open and easily accessible dataset suitable for evaluating several tasks in MIR, a field concerned with browsing, searching, and organizing large music collections. The community's growing interest in feature and end-to-end learning is however restrained by the limited availability of large audio datasets. The FMA aims to overcome this hurdle by providing 917 GiB and 343 days of Creative Commons-licensed audio from 106,574 tracks from 16,341 artists and 14,854 albums, arranged in a hierarchical taxonomy of 161 genres. It provides full-length and high-quality audio, pre-computed features, together with track- and user-level metadata, tags, and free-form text such as biographies. We here describe the dataset and how it was created, propose a train/validation/test split and three subsets, discuss some suitable MIR tasks, and evaluate some baselines for genre recognition. Code, data, and usage examples are available at https://github.com/mdeff/fma. | [Click here](https://academictorrents.com/details/dba20c45d4d6fa6453a4e99d2f8a4817893cfb94)                         | tags/class labels, audio                |          |

The labels are acquired from musical scores aligned to recordings by dynamic time warping. The labels are verified by trained musicians; we estimate a labeling error rate of 4%. We offer the MusicNet labels to the machine learning and music communities as a resource for training models and a common benchmark for comparing results.

In addition to the MIDI files, we provide artist, title and genre metadata that was collected during the scraping process when available. MIDIs in (MMD) were matched against a collection of 32,000,000 30-second audio clips retrieved from Spotify, resulting in over 10,796,557 audio-MIDI matches. In addition, we linked 600,142 Spotify tracks with 1,094,901 MusicBrainz recordings to produce a set of 168,032 MIDI files that are matched to MusicBrainz database. These links augment many files in the dataset with the extensive metadata available via the Spotify API and the MusicBrainz database. We anticipate that this collection of data will be of great use to MIR researchers addressing a variety of research topics.                                                                                             | [Click here](https://github.com/jeffreyjohnens/MetaMIDIDataset)                                                     | tags, audio                             |          |

The more songs people contribute, the better Tunebot works. Tunebot is no longer online but the dataset lives on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeufCM32pOk8mtUTb1lohKeihHQ-42HrsEUQPDIrUuwkczBUQ/viewform)   | song name(so transcription), audio      |          |
